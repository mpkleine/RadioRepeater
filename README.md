# RadioRepeater
This program will allow users to connect two radios in a repeater fashion. The main use for this type of device would be to link a radio receiver with a radio transmitter to create an amateur radio repeater. This program will manage the keying of the transmitter, the keying of an external CW tone board (initially built for a Compsec TS-64 board).
